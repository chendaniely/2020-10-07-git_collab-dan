Git collaboration

- `git clone <URL>`: downloads the repo from the URL to your computer
    - make sure you are not already in a git repo when you `clone`

- `git branch <NAME>`: creates a branch <NAME> where you currently are (HEAD)
- `git branch -a`: shows you all local and remote branches
- `git checkout <BRANCH>`: switch to the <BRANCH>
- `git checkout -b <BRANCH>`: create <BRANCH> and then also checkout out <BRANCH>
